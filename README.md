I am creating an app for The Pergamum library that helps managing books in the library. Each book has a title and an author, and the app has the following functionalities:

1.  Adding a new book â€“ will add a new book to list of library books.

2.  Get all books from the library sorted by the author and by their title (in case an author has more books).

3.  Delete a book from the library.

4.  Search for a book by title.

5.  Update the author for a book.

Techical considerations:
1.  The application is a RESTfull api, Java based application. It is implemented with Spring Boot.

2.  The application has a HTTP endpoint for evey of the above functionality.

3.  I have tested the application with Postman and posted the screenshots here: [Testing with Postman.pdf](https://github.com/gBogdan95/PergamumLibrary/files/10974523/Testing.with.Postman.pdf)
